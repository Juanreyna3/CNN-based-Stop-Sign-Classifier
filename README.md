## CNN-based Stop Sign Classifier - Computer Vision &amp; Image Processing

Developed custom classifier to identify stop signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch and deployed the model as a web app using Code Engine 


- Loaded 200 training images, and created features (stop and non-stop) for the classifier
- Trained a deep neural network (CNN) for image classification using transfer learning in CV Studio
- Deployed the model as a web application to IBM Cloud (Code Engine)
- Tested the trained classifier using 10 test images
